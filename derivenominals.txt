Nominal Derivation in Afaan Oromoo 
Derived Nominals from Derived Verbal Bases

1. Nominals Derived from Derived Casusative Bases
a. The Causative – S -
Many researchers haven't discussed that nominals are derived from derived causative stems. For example,
Temsgen (1993:11) result nominals such as ?abaar-sa 'cursing' and dallan-suu 'sadness' are derived from by the suffixation of -sa and -suu to the verbal roots of ?abaar-'to curse' and dallan-'to be sad' respectively.
eg. 
cab-s-aa
baq-s-aa
mar-s-aa
b. The Causative – is -:
gudd-is-aa
mul-is-aa
bal’-is-aa
c. The Causative – sis/siis -:
bar-siis-aa
fiig-sis-aa
d. The Causative – ess/eess-:
diim-ess-aa
glam-eess-aa
bar-eess-aa
boor-ess-aa
soor-ess-aa
qalb-eess-aa
dam-eess-aa
fakk-eess-aa
xur-eess-aa
jab-eess-aa
dheer-eess-aa
ball-eess-aa
lam-eess-aa
wayy-eess-aa
2. Nominals Derived from Derived Middle Bases
a. The Middle -at/aat -:
Nominals derived from middle bases are often underdescribed by researchers. For example, Temesgan (1993:13) says, in Afaan Oromoo, instrumental nominals such as har-ataa 'broom' and hidh-ata 'armament' are derived verbal roots har- 'to sweep' and hidh- 'tie'. The truth is that nominals har-at-aa 'broom' and hidh-at-a 'armament' are derived from middle bases har-at- 'to clean for one's own benefit' and hidh-at- 'to tie for one's own benefit'.

c. The Middle -ah/aah -:

3. Nominals Derived from the Passive -am ?
bit-am-aa
arg-am-aa
nyaat-am-aa

4. Nominals Derived from Complex Derived Verbal Stems
a. Nominals derived from Middle + Causative
Temesgen (1993:21) says that the middle morpheme -at- often precedes the causative morpheme -sis-. It is true that in Afaan Oromoo the causative can follow the middle in nominal and verbal derivations. Nevertheless, Temesgen is incorrect in placing the causative morpheme -sis- next to the middle morpheme because the middle morpheme -at/-aat is followed not by the causative morpheme -sis-, but by the causative morpheme -is. As we observe the phoneme /t/ in the middle -at- is changed to /ch/ because the vowel phoneme /i/ follows it. If the causative -sis- were followed the middle -at-, the phoneme /t/ wouldn't have changed to /ch/. 
a. sodaa 'fear', b. sod-aat- 'to fear' c. sod-aat-sis-/sod-aach-sis- 'to frighten'.
a. dubbii 'talk', b. dubb-at- 'to talk', c. dubb-at-sis/dubb-ach-siis- 'to cause to talk'
a. gaaffii 'question', b. gaaf-at- 'to ask', c. gaaf-at-sis-/gaaf-ach-sis 'to cause to ask'
